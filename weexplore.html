                <p class="progress-description">We Explore is a project that my partner, Daniel Babin {EMBED LINK},
                    and I worked on as our capstone project from January 2020 - April 2020. Through stressful brainstorm
                    sessions on
                    potential capstone ideas and a few beers later, we came up with an amazing idea. Our idea was to
                    create
                    an app that generates fun and engaging activities for users to complete either individually, or with
                    friends.
                    Once we knew what we were doing, we got caffeinated and started planning.

                        whether it was needed in the market. So we
                        thought to ask our target audience, young adults,
                        a few questions. The questions we asked helped
                        us indicate the type of people these students
                        currently are at this stage of life. It revealed their
                        personality and aspirations in life. From their answers
                        we built a user persona, to guide us

                        times I feel like I can get it if I try hard
                        enough. I'm also very receptive to other
                        people's emotions and see myself as a

                        development stage as well for the design process.
                        These drawings map out all the pages we were thinking

                        used our wireframes to build our pages and layouts.
                        From there we discussed what our branding
                        would be like; deciding on what sort of colors
                        and fonts we were going to implement. Using our
                        user persona we searched for fonts and colors
                        that matched the energy as our user which resembled
                        a fun and exciting vibe filled with togetherness.
                        Pulling inspiration from the ongoing
                        trend of bringing back the 80s we thought

                        sections in our app.
                        To tie it all together we chose Hobo-Std to be used in
                        our wordmark logo as well as some of our main headings/
                        titles throughout the app to remain consistent. As
                        for Open Sans, it was chosen as our body text as it is
                        clear and easy to read.</p>
